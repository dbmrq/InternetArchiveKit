Formed in Michiana in early 2006, Hoodoo Groove is a spicy jambalaya of rock, jazz and funk elements. The driving backbeat and jazzy guitar lines perfectly intersect with the layered horns and light- hearted lyrics. Hoodoo Groove first came together after the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina when saxophonist Chris Olivier found himself uprooted from New Orleans and relocated to Northern Indiana. Bassist Matt Miles contacted his old friend Chris to welcome him back. During that call, Matt and Chris agreed that they still shared a common love of music and decided it was time to embark on a new musical endeavor. Olivier dialed up trumpet player Mark Gamble and guitarist Justin Ross, members of his Chicago Jazz Project and they immediately signed on. Matt called Steve Krojniewski, a dynamic drummer who had played with Ali Babas Tahini, and the concept for Hoodoo Groove was born. We are excited about the way that this group came together, the chemistry that we have discovered, and the speed of developments thus far. For this reason, we would like to share some selected shows with the broad audience that the Archive caters to. For now we would prefer that archived shows be limited to those that are provided by the band so that we can monitor quality. These shows are for end user purposes only and are not intended for commercial resale. In addition, if other sites would like to post shows, they will need to obtain permission from the band prior to making material available for download. This is not a complete or official taping/trading policy for Hoodoo Groove. It merely gives Archive.org permission to post live shows to the archive that Hoodoo Groove has provided. For additional information about our taping/trading policy please visit www.hoodoogroove.com. Sincerely, Matt Miles Bass Guitar, Vocals Hoodoo Groove",

        "description": "Alliens Alliens - (al.e.inz) - A conscious-groove band that specializes in world rhythms, including but not limited to rock, reggae, funk, ska, caribbean soca, spanish hip-hop, electronica, and cumbia. A cross-cultural blend of sound is rooted deep in their souls from growing and living in foreign lands. Rock infused Reggae , Funk covered Ska, Caribbean Soca with a splash of Spanish Hip-Hop, Electronica Drum-Breaks meet Cumbia Dance Beats, and still more! Top it off with conscious multi-lingual lyrics and sweet trio harmonies and you get an experience that moves mind, body and soul. Through their seamless transitions and flowing dynamics, one message shines like a beacon of truth: forget your differences & dance! The band line up is a family affair at heart, the founders of the band being two brothers (Jamiel and Janiah Allen) and their cousin (Zeph Allen). Standing strong with these boys on stage are Cameron McLaughlin (Bass) , and Richie Ursomarso (Guitar). Taping Policy We allow taping and sharing of our shows/performances/concerts. Alliens requests that if you tape/record a show please come talk to one of the members of the band and let us know you are recording. If the circumstances don't allow that conversation please consider contacting us at alliensmusic@gmail.com If the performance you have recorded is from a direct line (from the board) then we require that you get confirmation from us before uploading the material. Thanks everyone! Share and enjoy!",
